# Minimal distance between two polylines

## Task

Given 2 [polylines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain) as `std::vector` of points the `arePolylinesCloserThanThreshold` in *distance.h* checks that if the
two polylines are closer to each other than a given distance threshold. It returns true if they are closer, and false if they are not. The distance threshold `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` is set to 1.5F.
